# bibliothek

a few utility functions I won't use but wrote anyway lol.

## Installation

You can install the library with `npm install bibliothek` or `yarn add bibliothek`.

Then you can import the library in your project:

```typescript
import * as lib from "bibliothek";

// your code goes here...
```

Or when using CommonJS:

```javascript
const lib = require("bibliothek");

// your code goes here...
```

## Building for Developers

1. you need to clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:avolgha/bibliothek.git`
2. then you need to install the dependencies: `yarn`
3. now you can build the project with `yarn package`

Happy coding :)
